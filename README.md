# Infinity-Edge

Infinity-Edge is a mini-game, based on the idea of the popular Android game "Infinity Loop".
As the same implies, there are no loops but only edges which offer the possibility for different crossing type figures.
Instead of playing precalculated deterministic levels, the player has to choose the style of his next level.
Relative frequencies of different figure types such as lines, end points, crossed, empty fields and more can be set manually as well as the field size.
Furthermore the degree of randomization can be set manually which correlated to the difficulty of the level.

#Dependencies

The framework depends on the Qt-Framework. The required modules are Core, Gui and Widgets (see the qtcreator *.pro file).
The software has been tested on both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 16.04LTS with Qt-Versions 4.8.7 and 5.6 but is likely to work with different setups (especially Qt Versions).
